<h3 align="left">üë©‚Äçüíª About me</h3>

###

<p align="left">I am a Full Stack developer. My path to IT began with taking an intensive course, where I learned HTML, CSS + JS. After the intensive there was a gap of a couple of months, where I tried myself in many directions, tried to learn the C# language, Python, tried my hand at Data Science, but most of all I was hooked on Frontend development! 
Six months later, I became interested in Backend development and studied Node.js and Express. Having also studied both relational and non-relational databases: MySQL, MSSQL, MongoDB.</p>
